	var articleTexts = ["In the early days of crypto community conferences, the number of women attending and especially speaking was notoriously low, but in the last couple of years, every major crypto and Blockchain event diligently features a Women in Crypto panel. The second <a class='link-text' href='#!'>Crypto Invest Summit</a>, which took place this week at LA‚Äôs Convention Center, was no exception; indeed, the conference went all out for a full Women of Crypto track.", "It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that the Women‚Äôs track took place on the day before the actual conference began. To avoid confusion, the event‚Äôs agenda page ran the following missive in red capitals: ‚ÄúNo conference and expo on Monday. Conference and expo days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday is Women of Crypto pre-conference track and kickoff party.‚Äù", "As one would expect under such circumstances, the audience for the track was a fraction of that which was expected to attend the summit proper. On the upside, just about half of the crowd comprised men, something the organizers noted as being a very encouraging sign of support from across the aisle.", "Speaking of the aisle, another statistic of interest: all 17 panelists in the Women of Crypto track were female, while on the Main Stage over the next two days women made up roughly 20 percent of the speakers. In an earlier interview with U.Today, Crystal Rose‚Äìwho was featured both in the Women‚Äôs track and on the Main Stage‚Äìmentioned her disappointment with the way conference organizers tend to structure panels:", "While the exclusion of men from the Women of Crypto track was a missed opportunity to foster integrated and inclusive discourse, it did give the panelists freedom to delve deep into subjects that may not have commanded the full attention of the ‚Äúusual‚Äù conference crowd.", "During the Blockchain for Good panel, speakers discussed how Blockchain and cryptocurrency can help the unbanked millions directly, but can also provide much-needed transparency to non-profit initiatives that serve domestic and international relief causes.", "Opening the Full Spectrum Blockchain discussion, Crystal Rose recalled that the Internet began as a space where users could interact anonymously, and only the introduction of social networks and online shopping began tying an enormous amount of personal data to our digital profiles. Today, Internet usage had come full spectrum to focus on the importance of privacy, sovereignty, and data ownership. However, sovereignty can‚Äôt be reclaimed unless there is wide-scale adoption, and adoption won‚Äôt happen until simple, easily manageable tools are available to the public."]

	var articleList = ["This is a sample of a list.", "Many panelists felt that the possibilities and opportunities promised by Blockchain technologies are especially urgent for women, people of color and residents of developing countries who are left outside the global financial system.", "During the Blockchain for Good panel, speakers discussed how Blockchain and cryptocurrency can help the unbanked millions directly, but can also provide much-needed transparency to non-profit initiatives that serve domestic and international relief causes."]
